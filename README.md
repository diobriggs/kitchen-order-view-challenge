# Kitchen Order Display Challenge

## Overview
This is a kitchen order display application for a busy restaurant. The React frontend is already built and working with mock data. Your task is to build the Node.js backend API and connect it to the frontend.

## Project Structure
```
├── src/                    # React frontend
├── server/                 # Node.js backend
```

## Your Mission

1. Build the API endpoints in `server/server.js`
2. Update `src/services/api.ts` to use your endpoints instead of mock data

## Helpful Info

- Check `src/types.ts` to see the data structure the frontend expects
- The database has two tables: `orders` and `order_items`
- The database connection is already set up in `server.js`
